# Intro to Creative Coding

This repository includes resources & course notes for students attending my *Intro to Creative Coding* workshops, demonstrating [p5.js](https://p5js.org) and [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io).

<center><a href="https://p5-demos.glitch.me"><img src="docs/images/grid.png" width="75%" /></a></center>

The idea and layout of the demos is heavily inpsired by Mark Webster's *[Designing Programs](https://designingprograms.bitbucket.io/index.html)*.

# Just Starting Out

If you've never coded before, you can check out this tutorial that explains some of the basics:

- [JavaScript For Cats](http://jsforcats.com/)

Also great is Daniel Shiffman's video series, which often uses p5.js:

- [Programming from A to Z](https://shiffman.net/a2z/)

A more comprehensive guide on the JavaScript language can be found here:

- [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)
- [Learn JavaScript in Detail](https://www.scaler.com/topics/javascript/)

And here's a useful cheat sheet to use as a reference:

- [Interactive JavaScript Cheat Sheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/js/)

# Code Snippets

I've also included a small "recipes" document that you can use as a reference if you are forgetting some of the patterns and recipes discussed during the workshop.

- [Code Snippets](./docs/snippets.md)

- [How-To: Functions](./docs/functions.md)

- [How-To: Timers](./docs/timers.md)
